Collect records that are spread over different rows in input file such that
    1) records of same icustay_id and chart_time are on same row
    2) redundant values for one id and time are averaged over

This script is able to process a varying number of medical variables assuming that they are listed in columns after (or instead of) the other three variables.

collect_records(file_in_path, file_out_path):
    input: path to file to be processed
    output: processed file at file_out_path
